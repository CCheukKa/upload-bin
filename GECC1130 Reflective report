University used to seem like the final goal of oneâ€™s studies, but it is not until one starts studying in one, that they realise it is merely the first step towards true scholarship.
I had been planning for my university studies since the beginning of my senior secondary school years. However, despite having planned based on a realistic and conservative prediction of my results, in an unfortunate turn of events, it had turned out to be worse than my worst prediction. To make a long story short, I had to modify my plan of studying Medicine last-minute. It was definitely a very traumatic experience, especially since I felt like I had been performing really well in the examinations, except for in Biology, where I was seriously sick.
I ended up studying Biomedical Engineering, which, by any means, isn't at all a bad place to be in, since it is practically the perfect fusion of all my favourite fields of study. I was borderline depressed for not a short while, constantly reconsidering my performance, looking for non-constructive solutions, and doubting myself. It was not really until a month of university life that I had been distracted from negative thoughts and started to plan. However, maybe due to an unsettled grunt, or simply due to it not being the path I had intended to tread, I am planning to try my luck with internal transfer protocol within CUHK. I don't think I would be satisfied until the day I manage to succeed, perhaps just to give myself the nod of approval that I am indeed capable.
Any destination matters not if one were not to take even the very first step. I am determined to achieve a satisfactory GPA in my first year, so as to give myself tokens for when I would be attempting internal transfer. In this semester, I had been performing moderately well since most of the subject covered is within my prior knowledge or is a proximal derivative of such.
