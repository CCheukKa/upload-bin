# Introduction
University used to seem like the final goal of oneâ€™s studies, but it is not until one starts studying in one, that they realise it is merely the first step towards true scholarship.  

I had been planning for my university studies since the beginning of my senior secondary school years. However, despite having planned based on a realistic and conservative prediction of my results, in an unfortunate turn of events, it had turned out to be worse than my worst prediction. To make a long story short, I had to modify my plan of studying Medicine last-minute. It was definitely a very traumatic experience, especially since I felt like I had been performing really well in the examinations, except for in Biology, where I was seriously sick.  

I ended up studying Biomedical Engineering, which, by any means, isn't at all a bad place to be in, since it is practically the perfect fusion of all my favourite fields of study. I was borderline depressed for not a short while, constantly reconsidering my performance, looking for non-constructive solutions, and doubting myself. It was not really until a month of university life that I had been distracted from negative thoughts and started to plan. However, maybe due to an unsettled grunt, or simply due to it not being the path I had intended to tread, I am planning to try my luck with internal transfer protocol within CUHK. I don't think I would be satisfied until the day I manage to succeed, perhaps just to give myself the nod of approval that I am indeed capable.  

# Current situation
Any destination matters not if one were not to take even the very first step. I am determined to achieve a satisfactory GPA in my first year, so as to give myself tokens for when I would be attempting internal transfer. In this semester, I had been performing moderately well since most of the subject covered is within my prior knowledge or is a proximal derivative of such. Therefore, I hope that I could keep it up in the following semesters, to aid my chances of succeeding.
Another one of my goals coming into university, is that I wished to be more proactive. I tended to be quite passive in my secondary school years. I didn't seek out or join too much events and activities, which made me miss out on a lot of opportunities. I didn't even join much societies. I would say I was struggling at this at the very beginning of September, seeing that I have missed some Orientation activities. But now I have committed to being a committee member of the BME society, although there were and still are some very tricky problems we have to tackle, namely a very serious infighting which had sadly pushed this whole committee past the verge of disintegration. Although we are trying to rebuild everything, it would definitely not be easy, to say the least.
